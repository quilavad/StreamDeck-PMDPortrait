# StreamDeck-PMDPortrait
## About
A plugin for Elgato's Stream Deck Software displaying Pokémon portraits from PMDCollab Sprites as a key.
Pressing the key changes the portrait to a random non-normal emotion for a set duration.
### Credits
**Code**: quilavad

**Assets**: CHUNSOFT, *various (see credits files in `assets`)*

**Project Template**: FritzAndFriends
## Installation
Download the file `quilavad.pmdp.streamDeckPlugin` from "Releases" on the right side of the main GitHub page.

Open the file by either double-clicking it or right clicking it and selection open. This should bring up the Stream Deck Software.

It will take a few minutes to install the plugin, and the Stream Deck Software will not display any progress. As long as the software was brought up when opening the file, all you need to do is wait.

Once the plugin is finished installing, the "PMDPortrait" category and key should appear at the bottom of the "Keys" list and can be used like any other key in the software.

The plugin file can be removed after the installation is complete.
## Uninstallation
Click on the "Preferences" button (cog icon) on the main page of the Stream Deck Software. Navigate to the "Plugins" tab. Right click on "PMDPortrait" on the list on the left, and click "Uninstall".
## Configuration
Each instance of the key can be separately configured to set the Pokémon displayed based on their (Poké)Dex number, form value\*, as well as if it is shiny or not. 

*\*Refer to the PMDCollab Sprites website for what each form value represents for each Pokémon. Select the non-shiny form and check the URL to see what the form value is.*

Do note that not all Pokémon have full sets of portraits, and that the assets used may not up to date with the website. 

Each key can also be set to have different reaction durations, in milliseconds.
